There are two types of plugins associated with this AASIMLS grant

The first kind are ones that facilitate quick replication of the
of the prototype's environment. For example, the "teaching image item type"
plugin does not do anything that cannot be done through the admin 
panel. But the plugin was created to facilitate the quick
addition of this specific item type by complete novices. 

The second kind of plugin is novel functionality. These add new features
to Omeka a la the traditional expectation of what plugins
are supposed to do.

LIST OF AAS/IMLS PROJECT PLUGINS

TYPE 1: FACILE REPLICATION

teachingimage_itemtype


TYPE 2: NOVEL FUNCTIONALITY 




This README is not required to be bundled with each individual plugin. 
For information on the specific plugin please see the 
plugin.ini descriptions for display within the Omeka platform. These plugins
are part of a demonstration project, and may still contain bugs.

These files contain traditional comments but also things such as BETA notes
which indicate where shortcuts in the interest of expediency 
were taken. For a proper complete release, and the final version
of the grant, all BETA notes should be addressed. But in the meantime,
the plugins should function fine even with certian coding
inelegances. These inelegancies are probably only visible to the small
exclusive group of programmers who develop and write code for the
Omeka platorm.
